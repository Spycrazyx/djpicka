        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          By purchasing or using our services, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for how you use them.
          We are not liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages, losses, or consequences resulting from the use or misuse
          of our products or services. By proceeding with a purchase or usage, you accept full responsibility and waive any claims
          against us for any harm or damage caused. Use our services at your own risk.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-400">SECTION #1</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          All sales are final — no refunds. Tools may be discontinued at any time without notice or compensation.
          Any attempt to initiate a chargeback will result in a permanent ban and immediate termination of your key and access
          to our services. Use of our services is restricted to individuals aged 16 and above.
          The use of stolen credit cards will lead to immediate termination and potential legal action.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          We do not sell any software — we sell license keys. In that case, everything we are doing is fully legal as we have not broken
          any laws or terms of service, as there are no laws against selling license keys but rather software itself.
          The software in question is gifted to you as a donation for purchasing a license key.
